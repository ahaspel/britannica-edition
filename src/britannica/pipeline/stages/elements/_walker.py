"""One-level shape-emitting walker.

Linear left-to-right scanner with shape-keyed recognizers.  At every
text position the walker asks "does any recognizer's opener pattern
match here?" — when one does, the recognizer finds its balanced close
and the whole region becomes one extract.  The scanner advances past
the close and continues.

No priority order.  No per-shape passes.  When two recognizers' openers
could match the same position, the one with the more specific opener
(longer match) wins — same semantics any tokenizer uses.  Each
recognizer is a pure function of `(text, position)`.

After the linear scan, an OUTLINE pass runs over the
placeholderized text.  OUTLINE is line-pattern based (indentation
profile), not position-keyed delimiter-balanced, so it operates on
a different alphabet — it runs as a separate phase, the one genuine
exception to "every shape is a recognizer in the linear scan."

Output: ``(text_with_placeholders, [(placeholder, shape, raw), ...])``.

    OUTLINE so the outline scanner doesn't re-trigger on its own
    bytes.  ``_allow_figure=False`` is passed for every recursive
    (inside-an-element) descent so a figure — a body-level construct —
    is only recognized at the article level, never inside another
    element or the figure producer's own re-processing of its span.
    ``_wrap_body=True`` is passed at the article entry point so
    residual prose between extracted elements becomes its own SHAPE_BODY

    pass False — those contexts don't have an article-level "body."
