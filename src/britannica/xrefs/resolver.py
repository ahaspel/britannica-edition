"""The shared core of every name→article index.

The old resolution cascade that lived here (``build_index`` / ``resolve`` /
``disambiguate_among`` — exact-title dict, display-parenthetical hints, LLM
disambiguation cache) is RETIRED: article xrefs now resolve through the one
``britannica.link_resolver.LinkResolver`` (fill + prose-fish), the same
machinery as the classified-TOC topics — docs/xref_resolution_strategy.md,
[[project_resolver_consolidation]].  What remains is the one primitive every
index builder shares.
